                Very nice library, different from the ones I visited before, plus it's said that it inspired the Harry
                Potter movies, which is kinda cool.<br>
                The queue is always so long, we wanted to get in the morning but it was almost impossible to wait so
                long under the rain, so we decided to go at the last schedule, we bought skip the line tickets, but
                we're surprised when we got in that it was sooo crowded you could barely walk or see anything, people
                wanting to take pictures of themselves and of the place, it made the experience unpleasant.<br>
                I think they need to work more on the organization and only let few people get in at a the time to be
                able to enjoy the beauty of the library.

                If you liked Hunger Games but thought it needed more rules, you're going to love
                Divergent!<br /><br />The debut novel from Veronica Roth, Divergent imagines a future after a great war.
                The only way to restore peace is to divide humanity up into 5 Death Frats named after SAT words. People
                join them by having only one personality trait: brave people join Dauntless where they jump off trains
                and punch each other. Smart people join Erudite where they wear glasses. Amish people join Abnegation
                where they don't eat hamburgers. And the other two are both Hufflepuff.<br /><br />In the EXTREMELY RARE
                situation where somebody has two personality traits ("I have glasses AND don't eat hamburgers!" -or- "I
                play baseball AND football") they are "divergent" (a Latin word meaning "too cool for
                school").<br /><br />"But wait," you say. "How do they figure out which frat to join?" I'm glad you
                asked. Pledge week in Dystopian Chicago consists of a hallucination where you have to choose between a
                knife and cheese with no other instructions. Then a dog attacks you. If you choose the knife, you are
                Dauntless. If you choose the cheese, you're not. Isn't that cool? That's all it takes. You either want a
                knife or you want cheese, and that decision confines you to a single Death Frat for the rest of your
                life. That's their NEARLY FOOLPROOF system. Knife or cheese. Maybe I'm not Divergent, I'm just lactose
                intolerant!<br /><br />Eventually the smart people use the brave people to kill the Amish people and
                only a teenage girl with two different interests can save them all. With her boyfriend. And something
                about a hard drive that controls humanity (presumably connecting via USB 27.0).<br /><br />Anyway, it
                doesn't make much sense but expect a million more books about dystopian futures where kids kill each
                other, because Hunger Games sold faster than a grey tunic in an Abnegation camp.

                Killing Moon is so cruelly, brutally misogynistic and brimming with every savage cliche of crime fiction
                that it’s barely readable … Nearly ten pages into Killing Moon, I wondered whether Nesbo had always
                depicted women in such a cruel, hateful way. Did I overlook it for two whole decades? … Perhaps some
                readers simply don’t mind Nesbo’s description of young women as ‘parasitic bimbos on the hunt for a
                suitable host’ because, as he asserts, it’s traditional …

                Maybe someone needs to remind Nesbo that storytelling in fiction allows us to explore alternate worlds.
                It lets us stand in the shoes of characters who are both like us and entirely different so we can expand
                our thinking and take on new perspectives. Storytelling that relies on tired cliches that frame women as
                hapless gold-digging victims who are lucky to have an ancient, alcoholic ex-cop on their case is a
                literary tradition we can do without.
